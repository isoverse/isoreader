\arguments{
\item{iso_files}{collection of iso_file objects}

\item{filepath_prefix}{what to use as the prefix for the feather file names (e.g. name of the data collection or current date)}

\item{include_file_info}{which file information to include (see \code{\link{iso_get_file_info}}). Use \code{c(...)} to select multiple, supports all \link[dplyr]{select} syntax including renaming columns.}

\item{include_raw_data}{which columns from the raw data to include. Use \code{c(...)} to select multiple columns, supports all \link[dplyr]{select} syntax including renaming columns. Includes all columns by default. Set to NULL to include no raw data.}

\item{include_standards}{which columns from the standards info to include. Use \code{c(...)} to select multiple columns, supports all \link[dplyr]{select} syntax including renaming columns. By default, everything is included (both standards and ratios). To omit the ratios, change to \code{select = file_id:reference}. Set to NULL to include no standards info.}

\item{include_resistors}{which columns from the resistors info to include. Use \code{c(...)} to select multiple columns, supports all \link[dplyr]{select} syntax including renaming columns. Includes all columns by default. Set to NULL to include no resistors info.}

\item{include_vendor_data_table}{which columns from the vendor data table to include. Use \code{c(...)} to select multiple columns, supports all \link[dplyr]{select} syntax including renaming columns. Includes all columns by default. Set parameter \code{with_explicit_units = TRUE} to make column units explicit (keep in mind that this will require specific \code{include_vendor_data_table} column selections to reflect the column names including the units). Set to NULL to include no vendor data table.}

\item{include_problems}{which columns from problems to include. Use \code{c(...)} to select multiple columns, supports all \link[dplyr]{select} syntax including renaming columns. Includes none of the read problems by default. Set to \code{include_problems = everything()} to include all columns.}

\item{with_explicit_units}{whether to include units in the column headers of the returned data frame instead of the column data types (see \code{\link{iso_double_with_units}}). Note that any \code{select} conditions have to refer to the column names including the full units.}

\item{include_method_info}{deprecated in favor of the more specific include_standards and include_resistors}

\item{quiet}{whether to display (quiet=FALSE) or silence (quiet = TRUE) information messages. Set parameter to overwrite global defaults for this function or set global defaults with calls to \link[=iso_info_messages]{iso_turn_info_messages_on} and \link[=iso_info_messages]{iso_turn_info_messages_off}}

\value{
returns the iso_files object invisibly for use in pipelines

\description{
This function exports the passed in iso_files to the Python and R shared feather file format. The different kinds of data (raw data, file info, methods info, etc.) are exported to separate feather files that are saved with the provided \code{filepath_prefix} as prefix. All are only exported if the corresponding \code{include_} parameter is set to \code{TRUE} and only for data types for which this type of data is available and was read (see \code{\link{iso_read_dual_inlet}}, \code{\link{iso_read_continuous_flow}} for details on read parameters). Note that in rare instances where vectorized data columns exist in the file information (e.g. measurement_info), they are concatenated with ', ' in feather output. Note that the feather package required for this export is not installed automatically as part of isoreader. Please install it manually if missing using \code{install.packages("feather")}.
