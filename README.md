## About

This package is intended as a unified one-stop command line interface to
all common IRMS (isotope ratio mass spectrometry) file formats used in
stable isotope geochemistry. It is an extension and highly stream-lined
re-implementation of the proof-of-concept
[isoread](https://github.com/sebkopf/isoread) package and is designed to
fit into a larger framework of IRMS data tools that includes the
web-based graphical user interface package
[isoviewer](https://github.com/isoverse/isoviewer) and the data
processing and visualization pipeline
[isoprocessor](https://github.com/isoverse/isoprocessor).

[isoreader](https://isoreader.isoverse.org/) enables the reading and
processing of stable isotope data directly from the data files and thus
provides a tool for platform-independent (Windows, Mac, Linux),
efficient and reproducible data reduction. Although implemented in R, it
can be used in both RMarkdown as well as Jupyter data processing
notebooks and also provides functionality for easy export to Python
using the shared R/Python feather file format. At present, it can read
most Thermo dual inlet (.did, .caf) and continuous flow (.dxf, .cf) data
files as well as Elementar continuous flow data archives (.iarc) with
additional extensions for other file formats in the works. Due to the
dynamic implementation and design based on the popular
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) style of R programming,
isoreader is easily extendable, takes care of error catching to avoid
pipeline breaks due to problems encountered in source data files
(modeled after [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/)) and works great
with [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages such as
[tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/),
[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and
[ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

## Installation

You can install the latest release of isoreader from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=isoreader):

``` r
install.packages("isoreader")
```

Some isoreader features including Excel and feather export depend on
optional packages that are not required for the core functionality of
isoreader. To use this functionality, please install the following
packages manually if not already installed (isoreader will throw an
informative warning if they are needed but missing):

``` r
# optional extensions
install.packages(c("feather", "openxlsx", "xml2", "BiocManager"))
BiocManager::install("rhdf5")
```

To install the current development version of isoreader directly from
GitHub, please use the devtools package:

``` r
# installs the development tools package if not yet installed
if(!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("isoverse/isoreader")
```

Troubleshooting note: depending on your workspace and operating system,
you may have to re-start your R session or manually install some
dependencies. For example, the `digest` package sometimes causes trouble
- re-install with `remove.packages("digest");
install.packages("digest")`.

## Show me some code

You can, for example, automatically read the data from **all** supported
scan files in a directory (and all its subdirectories) simply by
providing the path to the folder. The following code demonstrates this
with the example data files bundled with the `isoreader` package. For a
more detailed example including continuous flow and dual inlet file
reads, check out our [**Quick Start
Vignette**](https://isoreader.isoverse.org/articles/quick_start.html).

``` r
library(isoreader)
data_folder <- iso_get_reader_examples_folder()
iso_files <- iso_read_scan(data_folder)
#> Info: preparing to read 4 data files...
#> Info: reading file 'background_scan_example.scn' with '.scn' reader...

## Documentation

  - for a quick introduction, check out the aforementioned [**Quick
    Start
    Vignette**](https://isoreader.isoverse.org/articles/quick_start.html)
  - for a full reference of all available functions, see the **[Function
    Reference](https://isoreader.isoverse.org/reference/)**

    console and a list of available function will appear (all functions
    share the `iso_` prefix)

## Troubleshooting

If you run into a file format that is not currently supported or any
issues with supported formats, please file a request/bug report in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/isoverse/isoreader/issues). Likewise
if you run into any unexpected behavior or uncaught errors. Most
isoreader functionality is continuously tested on Unix and Windows
systems using [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/isoverse/isoreader/actions?workflow=R-CMD-check).
This makes it possible to ensure proper functionality and catch issues
quickly, however, sometimes something slips through or is not yet
automatically tested. We try to make sure to fix such errors as soon as
possible but ask for patience due to the small development team. If you
have the skills and are willing to fix problems yourself, that’s great,
please take a look at the development section below.

## Development

If you are interested in helping with development, that’s fantastic\!
Please fork the repository and branch off from the [dev
branch](https://github.com/isoverse/isoreader/tree/dev) since it
contains the most up-to-date development version of
[isoreader](https://isoreader.isoverse.org/). Make sure to write
[`testthat` tests](https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html) for your work (stored
in the tests/testthat directory). All tests can be run automatically and
continuously during development to make it easier to spot any code
problems on the go. The easiest way to run them is by running `make
auto_test` in the [isoreader](https://isoreader.isoverse.org/) directory
from command line (it will test everything automatically in a completely
separate R session).

## Open Source

[isoreader](https://isoreader.isoverse.org/) is and will always be fully
open-source (i.e. free as in **freedom** and free as in **free beer**)
and is provided as is. The source code is released under GPL-2.
